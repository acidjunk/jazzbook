- add new loop for playing entire chords not just arpeggios
    - likely abstract this out so we can just call like 'layer.addLoop()'
- add logic to handle when an arpeggio has notes that jump to another octave
    - keep all the notes in the same octave

- figure out how to support multiple chords/measure in the editor
    1. display a grid for the 1-4 chords/measure
        - this one feels most like a fakebook
    2. user specifies beats per chord

- refactor player so that other time signatures are possible

- add option to change arpeggio style
    - inversion
    - dont play 7th
    - simplified - think bass line style
- add edit button to measure
- create nice display name function for the chords
    - could include descriptions/wiki links
