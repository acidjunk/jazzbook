- implement pretty chord display

- add support for time signatures - will have to refactor player

- when you click on a chord, play that chord

- add new instrument presets + selection

- add logic to handle when an arpeggio has notes that jump to another octave
    - keep all the notes in the same octave

- figure out how to support multiple chords/measure in the editor
    - right now it evenly divides up the measure with the chords
    1. display a grid for the 1-4 chords/measure
        - this one feels most like a fakebook
        - use the beat value, but prepopulate the grid with the beat number as they add chords

- update playback to highlight which note is getting played in arpeggio feature
- refactor player so that other time signatures are possible

- add option to change arpeggio style
    - inversion
    - dont play 7th
    - simplified - think bass line style
- add edit button to measure
- create nice display name function for the chords
    - could include descriptions/wiki links
